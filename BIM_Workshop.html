    <h3> Accelerating BIM Research Workshop </h3>
        <p> There are many pre-requisites for conducting high-quality building informatics research. This workshop series helps students and faculty boot-strap that process by providing a hands-on forum where participants demonstrate and discuss topics of interest to our community.</p>
        <p>The 2018 workshop will have a special focus - working with BIMserver.org. BIMserver is the only IFC-based model server whose license allows use for any purpose. The workshop will be lead by Leon van Berlo one of the leading experts in and developer of BIMserver.</p>
        <p>When you register for this special pre-conference event, we will ask you to identify scenarios you would like to see demonstrated with BIMserver. If we can do them we will. If we can't we can talk about how to add such functionality to the BIMserver ecosystem.<p/>
        <p> Workshop attendees will need to bring their own computer. If needed organizers will help anyone who needs it to install BIMserver. Workshop organizers will provide some scenarios to help you learn the program and its ecosystem of plug-ins and bimBots. Bring your own IFC models and see if you can find a bug in BIMserver. If you, do you may get a specially designed BIMserver coffee mug from Leon as a prize!</p>
