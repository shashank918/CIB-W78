    <p>On behalf of the CIB W78 Conference Organizing Committee, we are pleased to invite
you to join us in Chicago, Illinois, for the 35th CIB W78 2018 Conference: IT in
Design, Construction, and Management, which will be held October 01-03, 2018 at the
Illinois Institute of Technology.</p>
<p>Like those before us, this year’s Technical Committee has put together an outstanding
technical program, with topics grouped into six clusters related to advances in
technologies, informatics, and computing for the design, construction, and operation of
building and infrastructure projects (see complete list of conference topics by following
this link: <a href="topics.html">Topics</a>. We have the honor of featuring invited speakers that include esteemed
academic leaders who have made significant contributions and impacts in our areas of
research.</p>
<p>We invite you to participate alongside these contributors through the submission of an
abstract and, upon selection, a complete paper. Please note, there will also be a best
student paper awards competition, and we thank you for promoting this event among
your advisees. The link for instructors on submission follows: <a href="Info_author.html">Information for Authors.</a>
Springer Publishing Company will release a print version of our full proceedings, titled
“Advances in Informatics and Computing in Civil and Construction Engineering”. The publication will be made available via Springer Publishing’s
indexing services (e.g. Scopus and Web of Sciences) and it will be released to institutional subscribers (i.e. university
libraries, commercial laboratories, etc.) via electronic collections. Springer Publishing
will also make the publication available in eBooks sold on Amazon and other online
outlets.</p>
<p>Extended versions of select papers presented at the conference will be published in a
special issue of Buildings.</p>
<p>As this is the first time the conference will be hosted in Chicago – and only the fourth in
the United States, with the first taking place in Washington, D.C. in 1986 – the
organizing committee will include a selection of pre-arranged tours into which
participants and their guests can opt to attend. World renowned for its unique
architectural style, Chicago is a global city and serves as an international hub for
finance, commerce, industry, art, and music. It is the third-largest, gross metropolitan
area in the United States and is home to elevated trains, an affluence of museums, and
a wide range of gastronomical experiences. To fully appreciate both the conference and
the city, we encourage you to plan for an extended visit.</p>
<p>We look forward to yet another excellent CIB W78 conference, and to the opportunity of
welcoming you at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. Best of luck in your
submissions and thank you all for supporting this important event.</p>
